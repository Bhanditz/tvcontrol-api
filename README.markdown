TV Control API
==============

This repository contains the editor's draft of the [TV Control API](https://w3c.github.io/tvcontrol-api) specification, developed by the [W3C TV Control Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2016/tvcontrol/).

Work on the specification has been discontinued in May 2017 and the Working Group was closed. The TV Control API should not be considered as stable, referenced or used as a basis for implementation. Discussions on scope, use cases and requirements have now moved to the [W3C Web and TV Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/).

## History

The Final Community Report of the [TV Control API specification](http://www.w3.org/2015/tvapi/Overview.html), published by the [TV Control API Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/tvapi/), served as starting point for this specification.

The W3C TV Control Working Group developed the TV Control API specification between May 2016 and May 2017. The group is now closed.
